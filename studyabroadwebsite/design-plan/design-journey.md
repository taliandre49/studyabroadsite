# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

My catalog will be about study abroad places and programs. It will include a reviews about each location!


### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

Students who are looking to study abroad.

This is a cohesive group because they all are looking for the location that they want to travel abroad to, they are all planning to study abroad but are undecided on where to go, and this site will help them decide!


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: find a highly reccomeneded study abroad place

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - include ratings of each location
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - by including this design it will allow for my audience to find higly reccomened places, the ones that most students enjoyed and hopefully tehy will choose to!

Goal 2: get to know a little bit about each place they are considering to go to!

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - adding an image and text description for each place
  - allowing the user to click on the image which will bring them to a details page about the specific program
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - this design will allow the indivdiual to really vsiualize and get an overview of the place that they are thinking of going to!

Goal 3: requirments needed to study abroad at that location

- include requirments for example a language requirment.
- this will allow the indiviudal to really keen on their desired location, seeing if they are even able to go to the desired location or what they would have to do in order to be eligible to go to such a location.

goal 4: wether the study abroad aligns with their major
  - include info on majors supported by classes offered at colleges in the location (reccomened majors for the location)
  - this will allow the indivual to see if the location is best suited for the mto keep them on track for graduation


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

laptop

considering the indivdual will be studying or have the form to study aborad on their lapotp it is only evident that the individual will use their laptop to browse for a prospective study abroad location, this will allow them to have a greater visualization of each place!


### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

![persona_consumer](/design-plan/personaproj3.jpeg)

Sofia

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- the requirments (if they are eligble)
- the ratings (if a place is highly recommended)
- the view of the place (wether the image of loctaion seems nice/fun)
- if the place aligns with their current education path, supports their major trajectory
**Goals:**

- goal to find a location that best aligns with their major
- to find a fun spot that is reccomeded by a lot of people (guarenteed to have a good time)
- get a sense to see if a location they are considering is a good fit.

**Obstacles:**

- requirments (they arent eligble for a certain place)
- cant choose which location is best for them (thus such design implementations will help with this)

**Desires:**

- to find a good place to travel abroad that they will enjoy
- to settle on a location that they like, are eligble for and supports their major

### _Administrator_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _administrator_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

the administrator audience are people who would like to update the site, this is either leaving a reccomendation, comment or updating requirments and major supported. They will also be incharge of mainting the site which inlcudes deleting any inccorrect information. For this we can specify the adminstrator to be the study abroad staff office, who will have this website as a "pamphlet" to show students intrested in study abroad programs

this is a cohesive audience because they all have the common goal of updating and maintaing the site.


### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: update site

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - a form to allow jerry to be able to input to the databas
  - insert entries
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - this will allow jerry the ability to update the site, including any newly added/ created programs that are being offered

Goal 2: maintain site

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - an option to allow jerry the option to delete an entry
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - this allows jerry to maintain the site, for example if information has changed, a requirment is no longer needed, or a program is no longer offered, jerry can delete it!

Goal 3: have exclusive "editor rights"

- implement a sign in and sign out feature

- this sign in and sign out feature will enable them to have exclusive rights to maintain and update the site!

### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _administrator_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

![administrator audience](/design-plan/jerrypersona.jpeg)

Jerrey

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- ability to login
- if data/ infomration on site is incorrect and needs to be updated
- new study abroad places
- new reviews
- new requirments

**Goals:**
- to maintain the site
- to update the site if new information (requirmnets/ratings)
- to delete any old/outdated information
- to have private access to such maintainance so that integrettity of site is maintained

**Obstacles:**

- inability to log in
- being updated with new correct information

**Desires:**

- wants to maintain the site
- keep integrity/ truthfullness of site with new correct up to date information
- wants to have private access so that only jerry can create changes to avoid chaos on the site



### Catalog Data (Milestone 1)
> Using your personas, identify the data you need to include in the catalog for your site's audiences.
> Justify why this data aligns with your persona's goals. (1 sentence)

- location name
- review of places (comments and ratings)
- requiremnets for the program
- majors supported by the program
- image of the program
- tags associated with the program
- descrip of the program

This will allow sofia to be able to really narrow down on an ideal study abroad program that she thinks best alligns with her goals, major, and passions. This also allows for jerry to maintain the site and give the valid information for each study abroad program, giving him a site to use as a "pamphlet" to show a student who is curious about the study abroad programs. This allows him to show sofia a visual and appealing easy to navigate site that will allow her to choose the best study abroad program for her!



### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Design your catalog website to address the goals of your personas.
> Sketch your site's design:
>
> - These are **design** sketches, not _planning_ sketches.
> - Use text in the sketches to help us understand your design.
> - Where the content of the text is unimportant, you may use squiggly lines for text.
> - **Do not label HTML elements or annotate CSS classes.** This is not a planning sketch.
>
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence)
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

![homepage](/design-plan/homepagesketch.jpeg)
This is the home page sketch where to make effective use of the laptop width screen i have flex-row and columns of the location and an image of the location. With a filtering option at the very top before the gallery, this was to make sure that the images and locations take up the majority of the page, making the images as viewable as possible and really exhibiting each location!



![details page](/design-plan/detailspagesketch.jpeg)
 This page will begin with the location/program at teh very top highlinting the program. Then an image of the location so the audience continously has this visualization of the place. then the program descriptions and requirments of the programed, followed by the overall rating and general comments/ reviews on the location

![loginpage](/design-plan/IMG_6171.jpg)
The login page will be to allow an admin to login and give sofia teh privalege as admin to upload a new program, fufilling their goal of maintaing the site and having authority to do so.

![insertpage](/design-plan/IMG_6172.JPG)
the insert page will allow the admin (once logged in) To upload a new progam, giving them the privelage to satisfy their goal of mainting the site.


### Catalog Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Explain how you used design patterns in your site's design. (1-2 sentences)

I used design plans becuase it is similar to the garden gallery catalog design pattern showed during one of our classes, it follows the list design pattern!


## Implementation Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)

### Database Schema (Milestone 1)
> Plan the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture.
> A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.
> Make sure you include constraints for each field.

<!-- upate from m3 -->
7 tables:

Table: programs:

- overall rating: int {NN}
- requirment: TEXT{NN}
- major: TEXT {NN}
- details: TEXT {NN}
- city: text {NN}

### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)
> Plan _all_ of your database queries.
> You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

```
$result = exec_query($db, 'SELECT * FROM locations)

$resultprog = exec_query($db, 'SELECT*FROM programs)

thinking of implementing an innerjoin on locations and programs by the name of the program.
would look something along the lines:
  $result = exec_sql_query(
      $db,
      "SELECT locations.name AS 'locations.name',
  locations.city AS 'locations.city',
 programs.rating AS 'programs.rating', programs.comment AS 'programs.comment',
programs.major AS 'programs.major',
programs.requirment AS 'programs.requirment'
      FROM locations INNER JOIN programs ON (locations.product_id = programs.id);"
    );

for filtering:
planning on doing a where clause such that we use the original joined query but if filter is activate we use a where clause for when the tag_id is = to the tag filtered for

my orginal query: will use the fiels of both the tags and the programs thus i must join my joins table and my programs table based on a where clause of the program_ids



```
## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Accessibility Audit (Final Submission)
> Tell us what issues you discovered during your accessibility audit.
> What do you do to improve the accessibility of your site?

to fix my audit fixes I had to improve the laveling of my input fields, i had to have the labels associated with my input fiels! I had no other wave errors.
### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Projects 1 and 2?

This assignment was a challenge, but a challenge i enjoyed tackling. It really allowed me to learn the importance of the debug console aswell as using breakpoiunts. This was something i was hesitant to use in projects 1 and two but am fully confident using now.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I learned a lot, I did not know that I would be getting this far in the content! Honestly it was great to learn to backweb development and learn the improtance of debugging purposes.
